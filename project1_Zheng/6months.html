      <p>Nestled amid the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, this tiny mountain town in Alberta appeals to both nature enthusiasts and luxury seekers. Visitors can spend their days skiing or hiking in Banff National Park and floating down the Bow River before retiring to one of the several opulent hotels for some spa therapy. Daytrips to popular attractions like the Columbia Icefield and Moraine Lake – renowned for its turquoise waters – cannot be left off of your itinerary. As the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies, Jasper is ripe for exploration. When you're not hiking through Maligne Canyon, whitewater rafting down the Athabasca River or snapping photos of Spirit Island, you can enjoy a bird's-eye view of the beautiful scenery from the Jasper SkyTram. Keep your eyes peeled for the 53 species of mammals that call this Alberta park home, including black bears, elk and bighorn sheep.</p>

      <p>A trip to Vancouver is all about embracing the outdoors. Vancouverites spend their days skiing on Grouse Mountain, swimming at Kitsilano Beach and strolling through sprawling Stanley Park. Plus, this British Columbia city offers plenty of cultural attractions, including museums and outdoor markets (Granville Island is a must-see). If you're not afraid of heights, head about 5 miles north of the city center to the Capilano Suspension Bridge, which is positioned 230 feet above the Capilano River. Montreal is a city of juxtaposition: Skyscrapers rub elbows with Old Montreal's 17th-century architecture while the familiar sounds of English intermingle with the foreign buzz of French. Visit Old Montreal to get a taste of Europe (think: beautiful architecture and cobblestone streets), then head to modern attractions, such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. If you're visiting during the warmer months, don't miss out on the Montreal Botanical Garden or panoramic views of the city from atop Mount Royal Park.</p>
