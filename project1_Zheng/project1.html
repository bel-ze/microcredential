<dd class="additional2_dd">Alexandra Stevenson never imagined what she thought was a loving relationship would turn abusive — or that she would ultimately become a victim of human trafficking.

Stevenson, who was living in Oakville, Ont. at the time, recalls how her boyfriend suddenly used threats and violence to control her, at one point saying she had to sell her body to cover the cost of her drug habit.</dd>

  <dd class="additional2_dd">Marissa Andersson and Oksana Kravchuk both own properties on the same Toronto street but didn't know one another until they say they discovered a troubling connection.

Their tenants, who told the landlords they were in a relationship, built extra bedrooms in their homes without their knowledge, leased them out to other occupants and haven't paid rent in several months, according to allegations filed with Ontario's Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB).

The two landlords say Saeed Aldairi and Melissa Tulshi combined owe them nearly $120,000 in unpaid rent and utilities, property damage and legal costs.

They also say they're concerned for the wellbeing of the occupants staying in the rooms – mainly international students – because they're living in cramped quarters that are a threat to their health and safety. They also say when the rooming houses were discovered, the tenants tried to freeze some of the students out by turning off the heat, blasting air conditioning and opening the windows. </dd>
