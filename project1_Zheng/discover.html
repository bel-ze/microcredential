      <p>There are so many activities you can do in Canada. These activities include taking day trips around the most popular cities including Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and even visiting the Niagara Falls. Some of the main attractions are seasonal. Amusement parks and lake areas draw crowds during the summer months, while others, like Niagara Falls and Blue Mountain, are popular destinations year-round. Some of these are even at their best during the winter months. From Toronto, there are a variety of tours offering excursions to Niagara Falls. Usually these tours are combined with a visit to the quaint town of Niagara-on-the-Lake. Some tours also offer a chance to see the falls lit up at night, either staying overnight or returning after dark. One of the most popular summer beach destinations, Wasaga Beach is less than two hours from Toronto and makes a great day trip in summer. The beach and shallow waters are often packed in July and August.</p>

      <p>Just an hour north of downtown Toronto, Canada's Wonderland is the country's premier amusement park, with some of the best roller coasters in Canada, along with other rides, games, circus shows, and the smell of candy and carnival food wafting through the air. The town of Gravenhurst lies on the shores of Lake Muskoka in the heart of southern Ontario's cottage country. This famous lake, with summer cottages owned by some of Canada's most well-known film stars and personalities, is a beautiful introduction to Ontario's wilderness landscape. This fun outing, about a one-hour drive west of Toronto, is not a typical trip to the zoo, and it's not just lions. You can drive your own car, at your own risk, through the park to see exotic and domestic wildlife. Or, you can hop on the Safari Tour Bus.</p>
